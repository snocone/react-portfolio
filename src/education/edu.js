                <h3>Programs at School of Dreams Academy</h3>
                <p>At the school of Dreams Academy my goal is to make 
                    our digital arts program the best in the state. To
                    do this I split up my classes so that I may dedicate
                    entire years to specific subjects for students seeking
                    to different skill sets. I thought it best to split 
                    up classes as so:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital Media Arts Foundations</li>
                    <li>Digital Media Arts 1</li>
                    <li>Photography</li>
                    <li>Video Game Design</li>
                    <li>Film</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This allowed me to focus each class on its core value
                    and principles as well as scale the progrma so that the
                    students would have a chance to grow as artists and 
                    individuals as they progress through the program.
